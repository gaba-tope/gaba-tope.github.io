As part of the [tidytuesday challenge this week (2024-02-27)](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-02-27/readme.md), I made an interactive timeline plot about events happened on February 29 a.k.a. 'Leap Day'. One can get their cursor on dots to see what happened on February 29 that year.

- R script to create the above plot is in [tidytuesday/2024/2024-02-27/2024-02-27 (Leap Day).R](https://github.com/gaba-tope/tidytuesday/blob/f72d532324a18a24e07b2b1c375e132701a15b33/2024/2024-02-27/2024-02-27%20(Leap%20Day).R).
- This is virtually the first time creating a plot with {plotly} package, and it took me a few hours to adjust to their grammars and rules. Let's dive into my script!

# Data Import
Loading a dataset from tidytuesday github repository as usual ~ <br>
```r
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-02-27')
events <- tuesdata$events
```

# Data Wrangling
1. I introduced a `num` column to assign a unique number to each row corresponding to a specific year. This distinction allows for separate plotting of each row.<br>
```r
events_data <- events |>
  group_by(year) |> 
  mutate(num = row_number())
```
2. A `year_int` column was added to group years into intervals of 25, with a filter applied to include only those after 1900.<br>
```r
events_data <- events_data |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(year_int = cut(year, breaks = seq(870, 2020, by = 25), labels = FALSE, include.lowest = TRUE) |> 
           as.factor()
         ) |> 
  filter(year >= 1900)
```
 3. For enhanced readability in the plot's tooltip, I created a `tooltip` column. Using the [`base::strwrap()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/strwrap) function, I formatted the event descriptions with line breaks at word boundaries (determined by the specified `width` parameter). The lines were then combined using the `paste()` function, incorporating `<br>` HTML tags for line breaks. For those using tidyverse, [`stringr::str_wrap()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_wrap.html) can be a good alternative for `base::strwrap()`.<br>
```r
events_data <- events_data |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(tooltip = glue::glue("<b>In {year}:</b><br>{event}") |> 
           strwrap(width = 50) |> 
           paste(collapse = "<br>")) |> 
  mutate(year_ano = as.character(year))
```
4. I often assign a dataset to another object to be incorporated into a plot script. This makes it easier for me to make a test plot using test datasets.<br>
```r
main_data <- events_data
main_data
#> # A tibble: 28 × 6
#> # Rowwise: 
#>     year event                                     num year_int tooltip year_ano
#>    <dbl> <chr>                                   <int> <fct>    <chr>   <chr>

# Plotting with {plotly}
Before plotting, `hline` function was created. It takes `y` parameter to decide at which y coordinate the horizontal line will be plotted.<br>
```r
# To add horizontal line in plotly
hline <- function(y = 1, color = text_col) {
  list(
    type = "line",
    x0 = 0,
    x1 = 1,
    xref = "paper",
    y0 = y,
    y1 = y,
    line = list(color = color)
  )
}
```
1. Plotly object `plot_ly()` was created. 
- Additional plotly layers can be added by passing the preceding object to next plotly function using the pipe operator (`%>%` or `|>`).
2. The function `add_markers()` was called to add a scatter plot. 
- The x-axis represents the year of events, while the y-axis shows the unique number assigned to events ocurring in the same year. Different y-values are for separately visualizing events in the same year.
- The tilde (`~`) makes the subsequent object to be searched within the dataframe specified in `data` parameter. That is, `~year`, `~num`, and `~tooltip` refer to the corresponding columns in the tibble `main_data`.  
- The `marker` parameter defines the properties of points for the scatter plot.
- Setting `color = ~year_int` ensures that colors are applied by the values in `year_int` column, showing the change of time by color spread.
- Setting `hoverinfo = "text"` ensures that the tooltip text of each point will be those in a `tooltip` column in `main_data`, as shown in `text = ~tooltip`.
- The `hoverlabel` parameter defines the properties of hovertext or tooltip.<br>
```r
event_plotly <- plot_ly() |> 
  add_markers(data = main_data,
            type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
            x = ~year,
            y = ~num,
            text = ~tooltip,
            marker = list(size = 20,
                          line = list(
                            color = "black",
                            width = 1
                          )),
            color = ~year_int,
            colors = cols_vec_ly,
            hoverinfo = "text",
            showlegend = F,
            hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = "black",
                              bordercolor = "transparent",
                              font = list(family = "oswald",
                                          size = 15,
                                          color = "white"
                                          ),
                              align = "left"
                              )
  ) |> 
  ```
  3. The `add_annotations()` function was used to incorporate the year of each event under in the plot, as well as subtitles and captions outside the plot.<br>
  ```r
  add_annotations(data = filter(main_data, num == 1),
                  x = ~year,
                  y = ~(num - 0.2),
                  text = ~year,
                  font = list(family = main_font),
                  textangle = -90,
                  showarrow = F,
                  textposition = "bottom center"
  ) |> 
  add_annotations(xref = "paper",
                  yref = "paper",
                  x = -0.07, y = 1.09,
                  showarrow = FALSE,
                  text = subtitle_event_ly,
                  font = list(family = main_font,
                              color = text_col,
                              size = 20
                              )
  ) |> 
  add_annotations(xref = "paper",
                  yref = "paper",
                  x = -0.07, y = -0.2,
                  showarrow = FALSE,
                  text = caption_ly,
                  align = "left",
                  font = list(family = main_font,
                              color = text_col,
                              size = 15
                              )
  ) |> 
  ```
4. Miscellaneous layout properties were specified using `layout()` function.
- Background colors were specified by `plot_bgcolor` and `paper_bgcolor` parameter.
- The title of the plot is added with the `title()` parameter.
- The properties of the x-axis and the y-axis were defined by `xaxis` and `yaxis` parameter, respectively.
- The horizontal line at `y = 1` were added by `shapes` parameter, using `hline()` function defined above.<br>
```r
  layout(plot_bgcolor = bg_col,
         paper_bgcolor = bg_col,
         title = list(text = title_event_ly, 
                      x = 0.02, y = 0.97,
                      font = list(family = main_font,
                                  color = text_col,
                                  size = 30)),
         xaxis = list(
            zerolinecolor = text_col,
            zerolinewidth = 3,
            nticks = 6,
            range = c(1895, 2025),
            tick0 = 1900, 
            dtick = 25, 
            tickmode = "linear",
            gridcolor = major_grid_col,
            title = list(text = "<b>Year</b>", 
                         font = list(family = main_font,
                                     color = text_col,
                                     size = 15)),
            tickfont = list(family = main_font,
                            color = text_col)
            ),
         yaxis = list(
           title = "",
           zeroline = FALSE,
           showline = FALSE,
           showticklabels = FALSE,
           showgrid = FALSE,
           range = c(-0.03, 3.5)
         ),
         shapes = list(hline(y = 1)),
         autosize = TRUE,
         margin = list(b = 80, t = 70, r = 10)
         )
    event_plotly
```
5. The `event_plotly` object was saved as a html file with the `htmlwidgets::saveWidget()` function.
```r
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(event_plotly, file = "event_plotly.html") 
```

# Add Font Dependency
If you are to embed your Plotly plot to website and use a custom font, it would be better to add a font dependency in the Plotly object. I initially encountered the issue that the plot displayed the custom font in R viewer and Chrome on my computer but not in browsers on other computers. It appeared that font information should be added to the Plotly object so that the saved HTML file would have details about the designated font. Thanks to the [discussion raised by 'fnavarro94' and commented on by 'cttnguyen'](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/issues/2117) for their guidance in solving the issue.  <br>
First, load a font and create a CSS string as shown in the following code.
```r
## Fonts & Colors ---------------------------------------------------
font_add_google(name = "Oswald", family = "oswald")
showtext_auto()
main_font <- "oswald"
# Font dependency for plotly
oswald_file <- showtextdb::google_fonts("Oswald")$regular_url 
font_css <- paste0(
  "<style type = 'text/css'>",
  "@font-face { ",
  "font-family: 'oswald'; ", 
  "src: url('", oswald_file, "'); ", 
  "}",
  "</style>")
```
Then, incorporate the CSS string to your Plotly object as the following script. [`htmltools::htmlDependency()`](https://rstudio.github.io/htmltools/reference/htmlDependency.html) function is used to add HTML dependencies like CSS.
```r
event_plotly$dependencies <- c(
  event_plotly$dependencies,
  list(
    htmltools::htmlDependency(
      name = "oswald",
      version = "0",  
      src = "",
      head = font_css 
    )
  )
)
```
This ensures that your plot displays the designated font, regardless where it is viewed. 

# Embed Plotly to Jekyll Blog
Since this github page was built using Jekyll, you may use iframe element to incorporate Plotly object into a post.
```md
<iframe src="/files/interactive_page/event_plotly_post.html" height="543px" width="768px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
```
